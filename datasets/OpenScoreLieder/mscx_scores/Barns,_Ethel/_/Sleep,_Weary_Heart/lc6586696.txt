Sleep, weary heart, May nothing more torment thee. Sleep and for– get the burden of the day, Sleep and for – get how much there has been reft thee. Oh, sweet rose petals scattered by the way! Only, dear love, in sweet and blessed dreams, A vision of the happiness and love that fled May come to thee Towards the dawn of morning Chasing away the darkness, fear and dread. The sacred fires of love shall flash a– broad, Scatt’ring the darkness of the night, Flaming to eastward where the morning Dawns in a flood of light, Dawns in a golden flood, a golden flood of light.
