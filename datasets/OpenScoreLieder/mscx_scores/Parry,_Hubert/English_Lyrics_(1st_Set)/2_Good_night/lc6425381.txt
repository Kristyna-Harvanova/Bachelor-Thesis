Good night! Ah no the hour is ill That severs those it should unite; Let us remain together still, Then it will be good night. How can I call the lone night good Though thy sweet wishes wing its flight? Be it not said, thought, understood that it will be goodnight. To hearts which near each other move From evenings close to mornings light, The night is good; because, my love, they never say goodnight.
