Where shall the lover rest Whom the fates sever From his true maiden’s breast, Parted for ever? Where, through groves deep and high Sounds the far billow, Where early violets die under the willow. Eleu loro, Soft shall be his pillow. There, through the summer day, Cool streams are laving; There, while the tempests sway, Scarce boughs are waving; There thou thy rest shalt take Parted for ever, Never again to wake, Never, O never! Eleu loro, Never, O never! Where shall the traitor rest, He the deceiver, Who could win maiden's breast, Ruin, and leave her? In the lost battle, Borne down by the flying, Where mingles wars rattle, With groans of the dying; Eleu loro, There shall he be lying. Her wing shall the eagle flap, O’er the false hearted, His warm blood the wolf shall lap, Ere life be parted. Shame and dishonour sit By his grave ever, Blessing shall hallow it Never, O never Eleu loro, Never, O never.
