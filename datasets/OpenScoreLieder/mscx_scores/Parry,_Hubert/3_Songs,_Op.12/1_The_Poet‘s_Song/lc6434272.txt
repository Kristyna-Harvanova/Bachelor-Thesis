The rain had fallen, the Poet arose, He pass’d by the town and out of the street, A light wind blew from the gates of the sun, And waves of shadow went over the wheat, And he sat him down in a lonely place, And chanted a melody loud and sweet, That made the wildswan pause in her cloud, And the lark drop down, and the lark drop down at his feet. The swallow stopt as he hunted the bee, The snake slipt under the spray, The wild hawk stood with the down on his beak, And stared, with his foot on the prey, And the nightingale thought, “I have sung many songs, But never a one so gay, For he sings of what the world will be When the years have died away. He sings of what the world will be When the years have died away, have died away, have died away.”
