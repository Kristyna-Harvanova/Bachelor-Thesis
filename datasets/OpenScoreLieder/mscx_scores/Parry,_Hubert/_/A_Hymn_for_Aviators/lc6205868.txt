Lord, guard and guide our men who fly Through the great spaces of the sky, Be with them traversing the air In darkâ€™ning storm or sunshine fair. Thou who dost keep with tender might The balanced birds in all their flight, Thou of the tempered winds, be near, That, having Thee, they know no fear. Control their minds, with instinct fit, What time, adventuring, they quit The firm security of land; Grant steadfast eye and skilful hand. Aloft, in solitudes of space, Uphold them with Thy saving grace; O God, protect our men who fly Through lonely ways beneath the sky.
