Some go smiling through the grey time, Under naked, songless bowers: Some go mourning all the May time, ’Mid the laughing leaves and flowers, ’Mid the laughing leaves and flowers. Why is this, why is this, Rosy Bliss Comes to kiss Winter grey? Why, ah! why Doth Sorrow sigh On the lap of lovely May, On the lap of lovely May? Happy love, with song and smiling, Through the wither’d woodland goes: Hapless love hath no beguiling From the redbreast or the rose, From the redbreast or the rose. This is why Woods may sigh, Flowers die and hearts be gay: This, alas! The piteous pass That leaves us mourning all the May, That leaves us mourning all the May.
