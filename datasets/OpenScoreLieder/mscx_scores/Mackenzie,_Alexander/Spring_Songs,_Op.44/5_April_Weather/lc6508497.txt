Life like ours is April weather Tears and smiles, smiles and tears Sighs and laughter linked together; Fears and hopes, hopes and fears, Storm and sunshine, hither, thither Shifting through the spheres. Storm and sunshine, hither, thither, shiftting through the spheres ’Tis love alluring, harming, healing; Bliss his yes! woe his no! Fortune’s smile and frown revealing Foe in friend, friend in foe: Mirth today, tomorrow Sorrow Guiding as we go, Mirth today, tomorrow Sorrow Guiding as we go.
