Summer hath too short a date Autumn enters, ah! how soon, Scattering with scornful hate All the flowers, the flowers of June. Nay, say not so, nay, say not so Nothing here below But dies, To rise Anew, with rarer glow. Now, no skylarks singing soar Sunward, now, beneath the moon Loveâ€™s own nightingale no more lifts her magic tune! Nay, say not so, nay, say not so, But awhile they go Their strain again All heaven shall overflow.
