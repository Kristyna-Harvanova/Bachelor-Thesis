Swallows soar in the blue, Butterflies dance on the green, Roses are blushing the garden through, With lilies laughing between, And bowers long stripp’d by the blast Have leap’d into leaf at last, And the whole earth is shouting, “Away with all doubting! The winter is over and past, The winter is over and past.” No pale face presses the pane, Open the casements start To the breeze that is balm to the burning brain, Surcease to the stricken heart, While out of the Maybush white The blackbird lilts with de light, “All melancholy Is folly, folly, When the June she is glowing bright, When the June she is glowing bright.” March was a hoyden rude, April a flirt unsteadied, May a melting maid to be woo’d. But June is a bride new wedded. Hush, oh, hush and hark For the nightingale and the lark Link in her praise Their passionate lays Between the dawn and the dark, Between the dawn and the dark.
