I wish I did not love him, or that heâ€™d love me, But what's the use of wishing for what's not to be; He's noble, he's kind, he's true as true can be, He has but one fault I can find, He doesn't love me, He has but one fault I can find, He doesn't love me. No, no, no, no, He doesn't love me, No, no, not me, He doesn't love me. My foolish heart goes pitapat when he is near, It beats so loud I wonder that it doesn't make him hear, And when I look him in the face, I think he'll surely see How tenderly I love him, then perhaps he'll love me, How tenderly I love him, then perhaps he'll love me. But no, no, no, no, no, He doesn't love me, No, no, not me, He doesn't love me. I'm sure that he loves somebody, I wonder who it is? I'll hate the very sight of her, If ever she is his! But what's the use of sighing, and crying, I'll see If I can't love somebody else, who doeslove me, If I can't love somebody else, who does love me. Yes, yes, somebody else, who does love me, somebody else, who does love me.
