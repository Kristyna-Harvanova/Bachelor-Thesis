We’ve journey’d together so long, sweetheart, That it's sad to be parted now; When your locks that were brown as the chestnut, once, Are white as the drifted snow; You've borne all my burdens with me, sweetheart, Through all that has come and gone, And it pains me to leave you to bear them now, To bear them the rest of the journey alone, To bear them the rest of the journey alone, To bear them alone, all alone, all alone. And after so long we must part, sweetheart, For it draweth to even tide, And we've lighten'd the toil of our long day's task, So cheerily side by side; You'll think of me often, I know, sweetheart. And the little one, too that has gone; And the tears that you'll shed will be sadder still, Because you must weep, you must weep all alone, Because you must weep, must weep alone, Alone, alone, you must weep all alone.
