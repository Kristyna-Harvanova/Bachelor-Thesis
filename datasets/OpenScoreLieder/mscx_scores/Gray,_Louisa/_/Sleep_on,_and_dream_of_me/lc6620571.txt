1. Sleep on my love the moon has rais’d her light, And thro' thy lattice silv'ry beams are gently creeping, While trembling stars look out from Heav'n and smile, As tho' sweet vigil o'er thee keeping, Sleep on my love sleep on, Methinks the night winds and breathe thy name, And whisper thro' the roses sweet "good for night" While at thy casement I murmur mur softly, Sleep on sleep on and dream my love of me. me.
