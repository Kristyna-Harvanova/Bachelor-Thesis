Under the cliffs a fair lady sits, Under the cliffs by the rippling sea, Over her head not a cloudlet flits, Gleameth the sunshine merrily; There at her feet the wavelets flow, Leaping and sparkling bright and rare, Cometh a true lover fain to know, What’s in the heart of his Lady fair? What’s in the heart of his Lady fair? What’s in the heart of his Lady fair? Cometh a true lover fain to know, What’s in the heart of his Lady fair? Eager and swift with a heart whose beat, Moveth ’tween hope and a dreary fear, Longing he falls at her dainty feet, Lovingly pleads in her list’ning ear; Turns she her head and the winds caress, Playfully ripples her golden hair, While from her bright eyes he well may guess What’s in the heart of his Lady fair, What’s in the heart of his Lady fair, What’s in the heart of his Lady fair, While from her bright eyes he well may guess What’s in the heart of his Lady fair!
