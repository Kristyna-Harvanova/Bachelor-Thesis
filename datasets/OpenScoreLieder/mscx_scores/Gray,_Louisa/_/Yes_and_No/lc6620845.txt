1. ’Twas earstill ly the in the Springtime That Don– though ald the courted me The birds were singing blithely, And bloom’d the hawthorn tree, He look’d so true, so easummer, ger, Yet I laughed sweet June and curtsied low, And tho’ I blush’d gain his a little I archly answered “No.” And tho’ I blush’d a little, I archly answered “No.” 3. Thro’ Autumn drear and Winter, My heart was like to break, For Donald was a sailor, And all for my poor sake But with the Spring came somebody, Whose name you’ll surely guess, For when again he woo’d me, I smiling answered “Yes.” And when again he woo’d me, I smiling answered “Yes.”
