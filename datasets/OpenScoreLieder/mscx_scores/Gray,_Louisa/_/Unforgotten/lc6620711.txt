I am list’ning for a footstep I can never hear again, And the yearning of my spirit Turns the silence into pain, And the yearning of my spirit Turns the silence into pain. I am waiting for a voicesound That be– long’d to other years; For a tone of old affection, Re– member’d now with tears Remember’d now with tears. I am longing for a hand clasp That can never meet me more; For the grasp of loving welcome In the happy days of yore, For the grasp of loving welcome, In the happy days of yore. I am weeping for a presence I must hope in vain to see, For a form, a voice, a footstep, All for ever gone from me, All for ever gone from me
