1. Men of Belgium! Honour’s own! Ye who saved the Holy Grail, Ye who died for Freedom’s Crown, Hail, ye brave, for ever: hail! 2. Wives of Belgium! who to Death Paid the toll of Mother’s wail, Bound with widowed sorrow’s wreath The brows of Death, ye dear saints: hail! 3. Maids of Belgium! ye who gazed At worse than sullen Death, and pale In terror, yet with eyes undazed, Smiled on at Hope ye sweethearts: Hail! Maids of Belgium! Sweethearts, Hail! 4. Land of Belgium! earth and sky For evermore shall tell thy tale. The morning comes! Thou shalt not die! Hail! Thou Sad Immortal: Hail! Hail! Thou Sad Immortal: Hail!
