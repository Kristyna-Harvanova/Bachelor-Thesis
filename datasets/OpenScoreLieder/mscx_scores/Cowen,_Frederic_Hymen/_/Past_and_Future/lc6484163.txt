think of the Past, and think of the Past tomorrow.
What shall I sing thee tonight, my love? Thou art sad, and I fain would cheer thee; There is gloom on the earth, there are clouds above, Still there’s sunshine while I am near thee; Shall I sing of the past, of our joyous Spring, When we heeded no sun nor shower, When our hearts were light as a bird on the wing, And we welcom’d each passing hour? Shall I sing of the day when first we knew ’Twas passion, not friendship, bound us, Our hearts were loving, Our souls were true, And all seem’d bliss around us? Shall I sing of the future, nay, love, nay, It brings a shudder o’er me, For change, and death, and love’s decay, In vision flit before me; And yet I feel, oh! my own true love, My spirit in Heav’n will meet thee, And thine will rejoice as it soars above, To know that I there shall greet thee, that I there shall greet thee. Oh my own, my true love, But I see thee smile, and my artless lay Has chas’d away thy sorrow, We’ll forget the Futture, love, today, And think of the Past, and think of the Past tomorrow.
