Faint are the breezes, and pure is the tide, Soft is the sunshine, and you by my side; 'Tis just such an evening to dream of in sleep, 'Tis just such a joy to remember and weep. Never before since you call'd me your own, Were you, I, and nature so proudly alone. Cushla Machree, 'tis blessed to be All the long summer's eve talking to thee: Cushla Machree, 'tis blessed to be All the long summer's eve talking to thee. Yon bark o'er the waters, how swiftly it glides, My thoughts cannot guess to what haven it rides! As little I know what the future brings near, But our bark is the same, and I harbour no fear; Whatever our fortune our hearts will be true, Whereever the stream flows, 'twill bear me with you Cushla Machree, 'tis blessed to be Summer and winter time clinging to thee, Cushla Machree, 'tis blessed to be, Summer and winter time clinging to thee!
