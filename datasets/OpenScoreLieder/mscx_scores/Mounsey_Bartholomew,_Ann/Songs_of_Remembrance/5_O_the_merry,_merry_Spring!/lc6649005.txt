The merry, merry Spring, the bright, bright Spring, What joy she shakes from her flow’ry wing! When the young bird sings from its leafy nest How happy it sleeps on its Mother’s breast, How sweet to roam at beauty’s side Thro’ glens, and dells, and woodland’s wide; How sweet to sit by a fountain clear, And whisper love to a Maiden’s ear! O the merry, merry Spring, the bright, bright Spring, What joy she shakes from her flow’ry wing! O the merry, merry Spring, the bright, bright Spring, What joy she shakes from her flow’ry wing! At merry, merry morn, or Evening still, How sweet to roam by the balmy hill; To cull a wreath of flowrets rare To twine ’mid the locks of a Maiden’s hair; How sweet to fly from care and strife, And the dull cold round of City life, To roam the wood and shady grove, And plight our troth, To the Maid we love! O! the merry, merry Spring, the bright, bright Spring, What joy she shakes from her flow’ry wing! O the merry, merry Spring, the bright, bright Spring, What joy she shakes from her flow’ry wing!
