Farewell! yet ere we bid a last adieu, Ere Ocean’s waves between us intervene; Ere other climes shall change the present scene: Say, wilt thou change with it? or still be true? Say, shall I then within thy mem’ry dwell, When all around thee beams with pleasure’s smiles? Say, will thy heart, in truth, resist those wiles? Say yes, say yes, and I can bid thee now farewell. farewell! fare well! Or, shall the cup of sorrow yet again, Already nearly full, be running o’er; Shall Fate, its sad contents relent less pour, While I, alas, that bitter cup must drain? that bitter cup must drain? Oh! no it cannot be! I know, too well, Thy love thy Truth thy Constancy thy Heart. Since then indeed To meet again we part, Tho’ deep in Sorrow, I can say Farewell! Farewell!
