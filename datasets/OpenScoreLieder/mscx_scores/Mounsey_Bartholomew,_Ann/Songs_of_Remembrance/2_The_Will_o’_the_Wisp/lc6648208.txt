Where the Snake lurks in the tangled grass, By the slippery brink of the dark morass, Merrily O! Merrily O! I light my lamp, and forth I go. And to lure astray the lated wight, I shine all night in the swampy hollows, Merrily O! Merrily O! Wailing and woe to the fool who follows! O! love, and friendship, and I, make three; We roam together in company! Merrily O! Merrily O! We light our lamps, and forth we go! Friendship showeth a steaddy ray, But her dupes ne’er dream that her heart is hollow; Merrily O! Merrily O! Wailing and woe to the fools who follow! O! Love, indeed hath a brighter gleam; What is so bright as her first fond dream? Merrily O! Merrily O! We light our lamps, and forth we go! If love be true, ’tis blighted soon: But false, or true, its vows are hollow Merrily O! Merrily O! Wailing and woe to the fools who follow!
