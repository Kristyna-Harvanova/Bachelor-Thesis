Oh the summer, glowing, blowing, Flowers in the sun; Oh the warmth and sweetness, knowing That the winter's done; Spring is just behind us, dying, Autumn just before, and flying, Flying are the days-No sighing can recall us one. Oh! Oh the summer, the swift breaking Of the early dawn, Sweet the blackbird's clear calling, Sweet, oh sweet the lark's note falling, thro' the blue the day installing With the rites of song. Oh! Oh the summer, the long fading Of the laggard light, Crimson gold, and purple shading Slowly into night. Where the earth and sky are meeting, Day and dark exchange soft greeting, Perfect moments, fleeting, fleeting, Sweetest in their flight, their flight.
Oh the summer, glowing, blowing, Flowers in the sun; Oh the warmth and sweetness, knowing That the winter's done; Spring is just behind us, dying, Autumn just before, and flying, Flying are the days-No sighing can re call us one. Oh Comes the sudden sun, awaking All it breathes uppon. Sweet the blackbird's clear calling, Sweet, oh sweet the lark's note falling, thro' the blue the day installing With the rites of song. Oh! the summer, the long fading Of the laggard light, Crimson gold, and purple shading Slowly into night. Where the earth and sky are meeting, Day and dark exchange soft greeting, Perfect moments, fleeting, fleeting, Sweetest in their flight, their flight.
