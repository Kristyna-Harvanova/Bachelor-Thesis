Clang, clang, clang on the anvil, In the smithy by the dark North Sea; Is it Thor that is smiting with the hammer. Is it Odin with the leather on his knee? Clang, clang, clang on the anvil There are steel ships wanted on the sea! Clang! Clang! clang, clang, clang, clang, clang, clang, clang! Clang, clang, clang on the anvil, For the forge, the forge of the Viking may not sleep! Clang, clang, clang on the anvil, And the hammers of the island leap; Britannia with her bright hair glowing, Has her eye on the furrows of the deep. Clang, clang, clang on the anvil, For the blood, the blood of the Viking may not sleep. Clang, clang, clang on the anvil, On the margin of the soulbright sea, Is it Odin that is watching in the shadow? Is it Thor where the sparks fly free? Clang, clang, clang on the anvil, There are steel ships wanted on the sea. Clang, clang, clang, clang, clang
