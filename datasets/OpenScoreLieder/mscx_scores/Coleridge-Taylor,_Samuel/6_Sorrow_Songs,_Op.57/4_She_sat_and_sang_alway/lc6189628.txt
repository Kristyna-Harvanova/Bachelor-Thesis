She sat and sang alway By the green margin of a stream, Watching the fishes leap and play Beneath the glad sunbeam. I sat and wept alway 'Neath the moon's most shad'wy beam, Watching the blossoms of the May Weep leaves, the blossoms weep leaves into the stream. I wept for memory; She sang for hope that is so fair; My tears were swallowed by the sea, Her songs died, died on the air.
