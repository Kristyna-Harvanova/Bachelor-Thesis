Oh what comes over the sea, Shoals and quicksands past; And what comes home to me, Sailing slow, sailing fast? A wind comes over the sea With a moan in its blast; But nothing comes home to me Sailing slow, sailing fast. Let me be, let me be, For my lot is cast, Land or sea all's one to me, And sail it slow or fast. Let me be, Let me be, Let me be.
