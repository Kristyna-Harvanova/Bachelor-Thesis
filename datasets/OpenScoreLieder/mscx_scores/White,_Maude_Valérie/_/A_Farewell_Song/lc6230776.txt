Farewell, farewell for I must go, Must part from her my heart loves so; But ere I say goodbye, goodbye, I’ll leave my heart in hers for aye for aye For the dear God in Heav’n above Looks kindly down on all true love, And therefore gave my heart to thee, And bless’d thy faithful faithful love for me. And I’ll return within the year, For none but those who lose thee, dear Know how it hurts to part with thee, Goodbye, goodbye, my love, remember me!
