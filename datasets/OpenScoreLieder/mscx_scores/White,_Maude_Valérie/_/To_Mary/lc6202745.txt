O Mary dear, that you were here, With your brown eyes bright and clear, And your sweet voice like a bird, Singing love, Singing love to its lone mate In the ivy bower disconsolate. Mary dear, come to me soon, I am not well whilst thou art far; As sunset to the sphered moon, As twilight, as twilight to the western star, Thou beloved, beloved art to me. O Mary dear, that you were here!
