I saw the moon rise clear O’er hills and dales of snow, Nor told my fleet reindeer The way I wished to go. But quick he bounded forth, For well my reindeer knew I’ve but one path on earth, That path which leads to you The gloom that winter cast How soon the heart forgets When Summer brings at last Her sun that never sets So dawn’d my love for you And chasing ev’ry pain Than Summer sun more true, ’Twill never set again.
