Let us forget we lov’d each other much, Let us forget we ever have to part, Let us forget that any look or touch First let in either to the other’s heart. Only we’ll sit upon the daisied grass, And hear the larks and see the swallows pass, Only we’ll live a while, as children play, Without tomorrow, without yesterday.
