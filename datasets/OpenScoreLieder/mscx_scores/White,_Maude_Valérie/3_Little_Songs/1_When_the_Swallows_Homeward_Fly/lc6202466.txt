When the swallows homeward fly And the roses’ bloom is o’er, And the nightingale’s sweet song In the woods is heard no more, Then I think with bitter pain, Shall we ever meet again? When the swallows homeward fly And the roses’ bloom is o’er When the swans fly towards the south Where the golden lemons grow, And the sun sinks in the west, And the hills are all aglow! Then my heart goes out to you, And forgetting all the pain, Hope once more within me whispers “You will surely meet again!”
