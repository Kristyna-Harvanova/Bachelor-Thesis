Oh! to be light of heart once more, To ride through the woods again As once I rode ere sweetest joy Had turn’d to saddest pain. Do you remember that glad day, That sunbath’d day in June When all the world was harmony And you-the perfect tune? No one will ever love a tune as I that simple lay, Content to live because you were So good to me that day.
