Will ye gang to the ewe bughts Marion, And wier the sheep with me? The sun shines sweet my Marion; But nae sae sweet as thee, as thee; but nae sae sweet as thee! Oh! Marion’s a bonnie lass, And the blythe bliks in her E’e And fain would I marry, fain would I marry fain would I marry Marion If Marion would marry me, would marry me, would marry me. Will ye gang to the ewe bughts Marion, And wier the sheep with me? The sun shines sweet, the sun shines sweet, the sun shines sweet my Marion; But nae sae sweet as thee, as thee, but nae sae sweet as thee, as thee, but nae sae sweet as thee. Will ye gang to the burn side Marion, And flowers pluck with me? The Birds shall sing of Marion; And Roses blow for thee, for thee; and Roses blow for thee. And love shall whisper Marion In zephyrs o’er the lea There’s none so fair, none so fair none so fair as Marion, There’s none that loves like me, there’s none that loves, that loves like me. Will ye gang to the Burn side Marion And flowrs pluck with me? The birds shall sing, the birds shall sing, the birds shall sweet sing of Marion, And Roses blow for thee, for thee, And Roses blow for thee, for thee, And Roses blow for thee.
