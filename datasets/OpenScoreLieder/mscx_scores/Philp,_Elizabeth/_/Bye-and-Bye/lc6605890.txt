1. There’s a little mischief making Urchin who is ever nigh, Stopping ev'ry undertaking, And his name is "ByeandBye:" What we ought to do this minute, Will be better done, he'll cry, If tomorrow you begin it, "Put it off" says ByeandBye, "Put it off" says ByeandBye, "Put it off" says ByeandBye, ByeandBye, ByeandBye, "Put it off" says ByeandBye.
