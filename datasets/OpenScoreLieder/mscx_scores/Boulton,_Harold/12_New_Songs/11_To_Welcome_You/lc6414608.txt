There are faces peeping out of all the flow’rs, And the little buds are wakeful ev’ry one, With their pretty lips that pout at chilly show’rs, Their lips that pout at chilly show’rs, Then open with a smile to kiss the sun, to kiss the sun. There are voices sweet and low amid the rushes That the ripples of the river gently shake, There’s a murm’ring among the alder bushes, As the wind is wafted gently o’er the lake, wafted gently o’er the lake, wafted gently o’er the lake Today I hear the voices full of singing, The flower faces smile and whisper too, The whole wide world with melody is ringing, The whole wide world with melody is ringing, And all, my heart of hearts, all to welcome you, all all to welcome you.
