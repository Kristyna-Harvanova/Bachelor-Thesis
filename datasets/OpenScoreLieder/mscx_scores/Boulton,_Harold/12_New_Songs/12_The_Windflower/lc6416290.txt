Ere buds and blades are springing, Or swallows northward winging, The white windflower appears. In many an upland valley And frostbound woodland alley Her starlike head she rears, Her starlike head she rears. The cold east wind hath kissed her, The snowflakes call her “sister”, And nestle at her side. So meek she lives and lowly, So fragile pure and holy, The spring’s unsullied bride The spring’s unsullied bride. But, when the hot sun showers His strength on summer flowers, Her short sweet life is done. So we one day discover Our life’s first bloom is over, Our Love’s first promise gone, Our Love’s first promise gone.
