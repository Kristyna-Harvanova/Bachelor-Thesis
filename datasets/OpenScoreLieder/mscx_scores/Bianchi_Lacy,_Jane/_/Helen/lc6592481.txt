Sweet Helen Sweet Helen Say not with a sigh that time at last will bid us part that when thy bloom of youth shall die the flame of love will leave my heart. Sweet heart. What ever change of charm I see thou always wilt be fair to me what ever change of charm I see thou always wilt be fair to me always al ways fair to me. Sweet Helen time from thy cheek may steal the rose: To smiles and dimples prove un– kind may rob thy bosom of its snows, But rob not Helen of her mind. Sweet mind. While this bright treasure dwells with thee thou always wilt be fair to me while this bright treasure dwells with thee thou always wilt be fair to me always always fair to me.
