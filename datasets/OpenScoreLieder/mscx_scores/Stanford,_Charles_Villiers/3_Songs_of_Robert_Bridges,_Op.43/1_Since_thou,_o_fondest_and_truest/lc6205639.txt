Since thou, o fondest and truest, Hast loved me best and longest, And now with trust the strongest the joy of my heart renewest; Since thou art dearer and dearer, While other hearts grow colder, And ever, as love is older, more lovingly drawest nearer. Since now I see in the measure of all my giving and taking, Thou wert my hand in the making, the sense and soul of my pleasure; The good I have ne’er repaid thee In heav’n I pray be recorded, And all thy love rewarded By God, thy master that made thee.
