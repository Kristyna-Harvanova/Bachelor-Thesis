1. ’Tis the sobbing of the Spey, Like the weary voice acrying Of a mother, lone and grey, For her lost own ones roevmantic er sighing; And where skies of sapphire glisten In the lands beyond the main, There are straining ears that listen As the voice goes out again “Bring me back my sons and daughters, Children of a vanished day; For the sorrows haunt the waters In the sobbing of the Spey.” 3. There’s a crying in the night Like a note of sadness straying; Is there ear can hear aright What the wafted voice is saying? Few there be who know, but rather Turn them to the worldly thrall; Yet wherever Scotsmen gather They can hear that homeland call. Saying ever, saying ever “Sons and daughters, why thus faithless do ye stray, While the sorrows haunt the waters In the sobbing of the Spey?”
