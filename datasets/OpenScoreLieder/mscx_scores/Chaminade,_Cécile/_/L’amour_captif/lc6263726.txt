Sweetheart, I have bound wayward Love’s light pinions, He nevermore can wanton otherwhere, Or ever forsake our true hearts’ communions. With a dainty strand of your golden hair, Sweetheart, I have bound wayward Love’s light pinions! I have bound Love’s pinions! Darling! I have conquer’d the wilful ways Of unruly Love, so décavopricious; Each law that your eyes declare, he obeys, And at last I’ve ended his sway malicious; O darling! I’ve conquer’d his wilful ways! My sweet, I have bound wayward Love’s light pinions: Why his parching lips forever exile From the bound of your coy lips’ vres dominions? On this captive mild deign to cast a smile; My sweet, I have bound wayward Love’s light pinions! I have bound Love’s pinions!
