Arid Winter has sought in vain Of our loves the fondness to lessen. The new year Aprilward doth hastpresen And se‿Et finds me at your feet again. May your Beauty no wonderment tonne That so loyal my vows yet cling, My lady, 'tis the time of Spring, It was in Autumn that we fell       in love. Then no more roses met our eyes, And e'er earlier darken'd the even, The swallows 'neath our gloomy heaven Flew away to more genial skies. The vineyards all their pow'r did tonprove, ne And our hearts to heaven took wing, My lady, 'tis the time of Spring, Will as in Autumn you return               my love? Anew the bush, weary of snow, Rejoices in roses fullblooming; A joyous knell, stern Winter dooming Is ringing on the bluebells now. The skies their gray garb do noremove ne And gay apparel o'er them fling, My lady, 'tis the time of Spring, More than in Autumn let us learn          to love!
