Her arms across her breast she laid: She was more fair than words can say: Barefooted came the beggar maid barefooted came the beggar maid Before the king Cophetua. In robe and crown the king stept down, To meet and greet her on her way; “It is no wonder,” said the lords, “It is no wonder,” said the lords, “She is more beautiful than day, she is more beautiful than day.” And shines the moon in clouded skies, She in her poor attire was seen: One praised her ankles, one her eyes, One her dark hair and lovesome mien, and lovesome mien. So, sweet a face, such angel grace, In all that land had never been: Cophetua sware a royal oath: “This beggar maid shall be my queen, my queen.”
