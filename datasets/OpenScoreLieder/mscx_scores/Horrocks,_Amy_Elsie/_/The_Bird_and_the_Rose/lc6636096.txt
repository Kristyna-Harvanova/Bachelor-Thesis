A rose that bloomed in a desert land Sighed in her loneliness; A little bird that was singing near Was touched by her distress. “Why are you sad, sweet rose?” he said, “Why do you weep and sigh?” “Ah!” said the rose “if I had wings To other lands I’d fly.” “Why do you linger here, dear bird, When you might fly away?” “Because I love your scent, sweet rose, In this lone land I stay. I linger in this solitude, To cheer you with my song.” “Ah! little bird, bear me away, Your spreading wings are strong.” The little bird raised the sweet rose And spread his pinions fair; He flew away across the sea Through the bright summer air. But when he reached his nest at last He sang a sadder lay; His joy was hushed. the lovely rose Was faded quite away.
