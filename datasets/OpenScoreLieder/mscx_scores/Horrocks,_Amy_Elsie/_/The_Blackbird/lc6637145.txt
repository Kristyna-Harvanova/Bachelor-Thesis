O, have you heard the blackbird, Upon the alder spray? He whistles high, he warbles low, All in the morning gray. He sings of February floods, He sings of meadows green in daisies drest, And fledglings in a mossy nest, Beside the woodland way, O gay! O gay! Beside the woodland way. O, I have heard the blackbird, Upon the alder spray. He whistled high, he warbled low, All in the morning gray: He bid me forth with merry cheer, While yet the thorn was cold with rime, He sang, he sang the songs of blossomtime, Beside the woodland way, O gay! O gay! Beside the woodland way. Come out and hear the blackbird, Upon the alder spray! Bestrew the wood with violet, And windflow’r white as day. The rustling boughs all greenly drest And ev’ry heart thet loves, that loves the spring Shall leap for joy to hear him sing Beside the woodland way, O gay! O gay! Beside the woodland way, O gay! O gay!
Above the waters clear and cool, Just like a boy let loose from school, He whistles high, he warbles low, All in the morning gray. He sings of op’ning primrose buds, Of meadows green in daisies drest, And fledglings in a mossy nest, Beside the woodland way, Beside the woodland way. He told me where the cowslips grow, And where the cuckooflow’rs will blow; He whistled high, he warbled low, All in the morning gray: To meet and greet the youthful year, While yewt the thorn was cold with rime, He sang, the songs of blossomtime, Beside the woodland way, Beside the woodland way. The tardy spring shall surely yet Bestrew the wood with violet, Bestrew the wood with violet, And windflow’r white as day. Shall rock around the blackbird’s nest, And ev’ry heart that loves the spring Shall leap for joy to hear him sing Beside the woodland way, Beside the woodland way, O gay! Beside the woodland way. Beside the woodland way.
