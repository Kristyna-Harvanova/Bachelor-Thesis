Red lies the sun in the west, little heart, Cold is the dew on the hill; Creep warm and close to my breast, little heart, Sleep and be still: Out of the shadows, come beautiful dreams, Out of the meadows, the song of the streams: Sweet o’ the world, they are whispering low, Lullaby, Lullaby O! Stars are beginning to shine, little heart, Lit by the angels above: Lay your dear head against mine, little heart, Pillowed in love. Out of the bushes, come beautiful dreams, Out of the rushes, the song of the streams; Sweet o’ the world, they are murmuring low, Lullaby, Lullaby O!
