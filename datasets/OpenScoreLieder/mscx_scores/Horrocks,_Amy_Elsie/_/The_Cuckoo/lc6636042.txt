The Cuckoo is the clown of Spring, Queen Summer’s jester jolly; He roams the world on easy wing, A flying, feathered folly! He hastes at will, he halts at will, No ties of home can bind him; But vagrant over holt and hill, He leaves his name behind him, But vagrant over holt and hill, He leaves his name behind him; Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! And Cuckoo! Cuckoo! ev’rywhere, And echo answers, Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! ev’rywhere, And echo answers Cuckoo! O Cuckoo, still our ears rejoice, You blithe and careless rover! For ah! when silence holds your voice, We know the summer’s over. Upon the merry breezes ride, A tuneful gypsy fellow, Till ev’ry rose is open wide, And ev’ry wheatfield’s yellow! Till ev’ry rose is open wide, And ev’ry wheatfield’s yellow! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! And Cuckoo! Cuckoo! ev’rywhere, And echo answers, Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo! ev’rywhere, And echo answers, Cuckoo! Cuckoo!
