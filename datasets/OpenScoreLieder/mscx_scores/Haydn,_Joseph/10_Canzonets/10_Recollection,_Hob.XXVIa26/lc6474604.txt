The season comes when first we met, But you return no more, but you return no more; Why cannot I the days forget Which time can ne’er restore, can ne’er restore? Why cannot I the days forget Which time can ne’er restore, can ne’er restore? Oh! days too fair, too bright to last, Are you indeed for ever past? Oh! days too fair, too bright to last, Are you indeed for ever past? Oh! days too fair, too bright to last, Are you indeed for ever past, are you indeed for ever past, are you indeed for ever past? The fleeting shadows of de light In memory I trace, in memory I trace In fancy stop their rapidflight And all the past replace, the past replace. In fancy stop their rapidflight, And all the past replace, the past replace. But ah! I wake to endless woes, And tears the fading visions close. But ah! I wake to endless woes, And tears the fading visions close. But ah! I wake to endless woes And tears the fading visions close, and tears the fading visions close, are tears the fading visions close.
