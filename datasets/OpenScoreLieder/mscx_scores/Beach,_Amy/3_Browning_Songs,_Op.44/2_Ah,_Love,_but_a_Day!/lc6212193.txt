Ah, Love, but a day, And the world has changed! Ah, Love, but a day, And the world has changed! The sun's away, And the bird estranged; The wind has dropped, And the skyâ€™s deranged; Summer, Summer has stopped, Summer has stopped. Ah, Love, but a day, And the world has changed! Look in my eyes! Wilt thou change too? Look in my eyes! Wilt thou change too? Should I fear surprise? Shall I find aught new In the old and dear, In the good and true, With the changing year? Ah, Love, Look in my eyes, Look in my eyes, Wilt thou change too?
