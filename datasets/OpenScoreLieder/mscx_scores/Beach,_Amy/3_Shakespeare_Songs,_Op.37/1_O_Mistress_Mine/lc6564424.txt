O mistress mine, where are you roaming? O stay and hear, your true love’s coming That can sing both high and low, both high both high and low, low, Trip no further, pretty sweeting; Journeys end in lovers meeting, Trip no further pretty sweeting; Journeys end in lovers meeting, Ev’ry wise man’s son doth know, Ah, ev’ry wise man’s son doth know. What is love? ’tis not hereafter; Present mirth hath present laughtter; What’s to come is still unsure, What’s to come is still unsure, unsure: In delay there lies no plenty; Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty, In delay there lies no plenty, Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty; Youth’s a stuff will not endure, Ah, Youth’s a stuff will not endure.
