Take, O take those lips away, That so sweetly were forsworn; Take, O take those lips away, That so sweetly were forsworn, And those eyes, the break of day, Lights that do mislead the morn: But my kisses bring again, Seals of love, but seal’d in vain, But my kisses bring again, Seals of love, but seal’d in vain. Ah, Seal’d in vain.
