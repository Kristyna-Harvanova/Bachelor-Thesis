O sweet the rose in summer blowing, And sweet the blackbird’s chanted lay; And oh! how fair the lily glowing Be– neath the golden eye of day. And yet I know a joy excelling The raptures of a poet’s telling, The lily’s lamp, the radiant rose, It is that surest, purest pleasure, That in our heart of hearts we treasure, The love that only Heaven knows. When so much wealth we hold within us, Our hearts from ev’ry care are free, For calm contentment it must win us, Though tossed like foam upon life's sea. Aye, though all ills conspire to flout us, Yet love’s within, around, about us, A tower of strength, an angel arm, It is the torch that flames beside us Through labyrinthine glooms to guide us, ’Tis May in winter, peace in storm.
