Clasp mine closer, little dear white Hand  Clasp mine fastly, till it grows so cold, All your tender pressures will be vain To awake an answ’ring touch again, Till it lieth underneath the mould. In Life’s storm, and in Life’s sun, ’tis you Who have guided me throughout the land Straightly__ where the path was most obscure, Purely, for who touches you is pure__ Little Hand, O little lovèd Hand. Paradise without you could not be. Paradise without you could not be. I will wait outside till I behold You appear. Clasp mine closer, little Hand__ Clasp it closer, closer! . . . .
