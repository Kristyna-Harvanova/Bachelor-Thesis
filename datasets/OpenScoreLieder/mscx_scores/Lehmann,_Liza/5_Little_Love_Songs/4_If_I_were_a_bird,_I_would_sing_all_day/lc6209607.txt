If I were a bird I would sing all day; I would sing of you To the dropping dew, To the heaven’s blue, All the praise I knew, Till the whole world heard-If I were a bird. If I were a bird! If I were a flow’r-Say, a daisy small-I would kiss your feet When I saw you fleet, Pass me by, O sweet! I would murmur “Dear” All the summer hour-If I were a flow’r. If I were a flow’r, I would kiss your feet-If I were a bird, I would sing, my sweet, Till the whole world heard-If I were a bird!
