There's a bird beneath your window, There's a sunbeam that slips in, There's a rose bush in your garden Where a spider learns to spin. And we're all in league against you, Bird and flow'r and gold sundart, And the web the spider's spinning Is the mesh to hold your heart Is the mesh to hold your heart.
