My sister Nell is very fair, She has twisted up her wavy hair; Her skirts are made without tucks now, She has learnt to behave, She knows just how. The neighbours call her: "Sweet Seventeen"; She dresses just like a fairy queen; She has gowns of silk and hats of lace, But far the prettiest is her face.
