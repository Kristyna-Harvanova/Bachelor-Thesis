Ah! Ah!
There’s a ball, just think, a ball tonight, The ball is given for Nell. There are lights and flowers ev’rywhere, I hear the music swell. It was halfpastnine when the dance began, They thought I was safe in bed, But I crept along with naked feet, And crouched on the stairs instead! And Jane, the housemaid, won't betray, She is very kind and nice; She brought me a glass of lemonade, And a great big strawberry ice. Ah! Ah! Once Nell came and sat sclose by, With an officer, oh so smart! He said “he had never loved before, But tonight he had lost his heart!” I could not hear what her answer was, I nearly died of laughing, But just look out for tomorrow, Nell, I think there will be some chaffing!
