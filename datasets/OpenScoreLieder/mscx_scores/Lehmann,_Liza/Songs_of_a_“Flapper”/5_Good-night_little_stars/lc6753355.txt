I am getting drowsy; I was up with the rising sun, And the old Dutch clock on the staircase Has just struck one. Good– night, little stars, goodnight, How you twinkle and peep and stare! I know it is terribly, terribly late, Goodnight little stars up there. The nightbreeze blows through my window, To my little white bed I'll creep. You'll only have time to twinkle twice Before I am fast asleep. Good-night, little stars up there, little stars, goodnight, goodnight, goodnight!
