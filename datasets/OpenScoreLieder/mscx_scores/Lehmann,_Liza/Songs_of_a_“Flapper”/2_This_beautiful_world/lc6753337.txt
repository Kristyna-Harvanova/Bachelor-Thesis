What a beautiful, beautiful world it is! How can people ever be sad? What is it makes them grumble and frown, And sigh that the “times are bad?” When the sky is blue and the grass is green, And the hay has been stack’d for over a week, When the lark is carolling harvest hymns, And the apple is showing a rosy cheek, What a beautiful world it is! What a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful world it is!
