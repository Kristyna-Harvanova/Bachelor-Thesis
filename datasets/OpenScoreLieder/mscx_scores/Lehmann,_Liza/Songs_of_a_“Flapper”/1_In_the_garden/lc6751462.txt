The white rose nods to the muskrose, And the muskrose nods to the white, But I am friends with ev’ry flower, And I nod to them left and right. Oh, tall is the tigerlily, And stately the holly– hock, But I love best the dear little daisy In her simple workaday frock. Hal– lo! ‘Red Admiral’ there sir, You are early out to– day! And I am too, so beware, sir, For this is a holiday!
