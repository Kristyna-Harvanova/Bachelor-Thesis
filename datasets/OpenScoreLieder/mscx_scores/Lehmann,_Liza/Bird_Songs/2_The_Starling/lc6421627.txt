On her nest, with her young, Sat the Starling in the steeple, While below the great bell swung To the church to call the people. ”Mother, mother,” cried the starlings, ”What is that? oh mother, tell!” “Don’t be frightened, little darlings, 'Tis the great church bell, Ringing out its solemn warning, That the people far and near All may know 'tis Sunday morning, And make haste to gather here. While the organ’s sweetly playing Little birds need have no fear! While below the folk are praying, You can sing your hymns up here!”
