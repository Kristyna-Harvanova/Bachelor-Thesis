On a sultry Summer morning Down the dusty road we stray’d, And plucked the wayside flowers, And ran and laughed and played! There was not the slightest breeze, And we wearied of our play, And then we heard the yellowhammer say: “A little bit of bread and no cheese!” Once again we roamed the woodland, When the years had fleeted by, And, poor as mice, we pledged Our vows, my love and I. We had kiss’d beneath the trees, And then we heard again The yellowhammer say, quite plain: “A little bit of bread and no cheese!”
