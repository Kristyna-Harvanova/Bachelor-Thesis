Three little owlets In a hollow tree, Cuddled up together Close as could be. When the moon shone out And the dew lay wet, Mother flew about To see what she could get. She caught a little mouse So velvety and soft, She caught some little sparrows, And then she flew aloft To the three little owlets In a hollow tree, Cuddled up together Close as could be. “Tu whoo,” said the old owl, “Isn’t this good cheer?” “Tu-whit,” said the owlets, “Thank you, mother dear, Tu-whit, tu-whit, tu-whit, tu-whit Tu-whoo!”
