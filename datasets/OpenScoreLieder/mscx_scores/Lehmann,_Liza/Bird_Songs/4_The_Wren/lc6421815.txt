A wren just under my window Has suddenly, sweetly sung; He woke me from my slumbers With his sweet shrill tongue. It was so very early, The dewdrops were not dry, And pearly cloudlets floated Across the rosy sky. Ah  His nest is in the ivy Where his little wife sits all day, And by her side he sings to her, And never flies far away.
