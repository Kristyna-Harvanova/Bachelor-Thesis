shark over rest in the
Oh, hush thee, my baby, the night is behind us, And black are the waters that sparkled so green. The moon o’er the combers looks downward to find us At rest in the hollows that rustle be tween. Where billow meets billow, there soft be thy pillow, Oh, weary young flipperling, curl at thy ease, The storm shall not wake thee, nor shark overtake thee, Asleep in the arms of the slow swinging seas. Then hush thee, my baby the night is behind us, And black are the waters that sparkled so green. The moon o’er the combers looks downward to find us, At rest in the hollows that rustle between, At rest in the hollows that rustle between.
