You mustn’t swim till you’re six weeks old Or your head will be sunk by your heels; For summer gales and killer whales Are bad for baby seals. No, you mustn’t swim till you’re six weeks old, Or your head will be sunk by the heels; For summer gales and killer whales Are bad for baby seals, Are bad for baby seals, dear Rat, As bad as bad can be. But splash and grow strong And you can’t go wrong, Child of the open sea, Splash, grow strong, And you can’t go wrong, Child of the open sea. Ah! Ah! You mustn’t swim till you’re six weeks old, Child of the open sea!
