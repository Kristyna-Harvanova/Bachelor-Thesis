Oh! I have had dreams, I have had sweet dreams Of childhood’s bright and sunny hours, When I wander’d all day by the sparkling streams, And cull’d for my mother the gay wild flow’rs. When I wove her a wreath of the greenwoodbine, And twin’d in it berries and violets gay! And I crown’d her pale forehead and she kiss’d mine, Ah! she like the flowers has faded away, She has faded away! faded away! I have had bright dreams of the old elm tree, Beneath whose branches spreading wide, I have sported away, in childish glee the fleetwinged hours of the even tide. I have dream’d of the friends once gather’d there, To frolic away the long summer’s day, Untrammel’d by fear, unwearied by care, But they like the rest have faded away, They have faded away, faded away. I have had bright deams as I’ve wander’d alone, When still midnight in silence reign’d, When my own pale star shone bright from its throne, And in visions of hope my soul was chain’d. But the cares of earth would come again, The heart would grow sick with hope’s delay, And the vissions I wove of my destiny then Ah! they like the rest have faded away, they have faded away, faded away.
