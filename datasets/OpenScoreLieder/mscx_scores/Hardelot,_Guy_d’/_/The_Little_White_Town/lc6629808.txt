There’s a little white town not far from the sea, And away from the world, where I fain would be; Thers’s a little white town That runs up hill and down, There’s a little white town in my own countrie. There’s a little white house, and, if I were free To make my choice, I would rather be In that haven of rest With the one I love best Than dwell anywhere else in the whole counttrie. There’s a little white gown that is more to me Than all other gowns in the world coule be; There’s a little white gown Being sewn in the town That is dear to my heart in my own countrie. For when the last stitch has been sewn, you seem That little white gown will be worn for me, In that little white town That runs up hill and down, By the happiest bride in the whole countrie.
