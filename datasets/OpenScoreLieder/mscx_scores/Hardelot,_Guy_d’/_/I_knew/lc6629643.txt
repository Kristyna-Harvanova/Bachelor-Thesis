Cold is the world, e’er yet the dawn Awakes in splendour bright, Dark is the earth at early morn Before the sun gives light. And so my life was dull and grey Before Love came to me, But now ’tis chang’d to brightest day, And filled with melody. I did not deem this world could hold A joy so deep, so true, Till thy dear arms did me enfold And then I knew, I knew.
