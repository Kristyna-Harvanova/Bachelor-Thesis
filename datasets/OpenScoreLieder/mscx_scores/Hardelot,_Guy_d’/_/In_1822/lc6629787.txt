In eighteen hundred and twenty two, Grandpapa in a coat of blue Met Grandmamma in a green silk gown, And hat to match, on her way from town Grandpapa, with a "By your leave," Offered an arm in a blue coat sleeve Which Grandma took –––– 'twas a trifle rash, As green and blue are supposed to clash. But, though the colours perhaps were wrong, They found the way rather short than long; While Grandpapa (d'you condemn his taste?) Put a blue cloth arm round a green silk waist. Grandmamma not re– senting this, He next proceeded to steal a kiss; While she confidingly laid, I'm told, Her bright green hat on his shoulder bold. A few more words and my story's done. Two hearts are still that once beat as one, But the green silk dress in an old oak chest Lies folded close to the blue cloth breast.
