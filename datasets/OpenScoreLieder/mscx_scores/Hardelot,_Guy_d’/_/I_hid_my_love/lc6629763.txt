I hid my love in the heart of a rose, All day near your heart you let it rest, From dewy morn till twilight close, And you never guessed! I hid my love in the lilt of a song, You caught the melody rippling through, It came to your lips the whole day long, Yet you never knew! I hid my love in the depths of my heart, The heart that I deemed could hold it fast, But it broke its bonds when we came to part, And you knew at last!
