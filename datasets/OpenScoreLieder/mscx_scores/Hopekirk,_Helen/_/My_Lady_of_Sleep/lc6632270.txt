Ah, but thou com’st so gently Over the starlit deep, Starry are thine eyes to me, Ever a new surprise to me, Yet I’d weep, weep and weep, Yet I’d weep, weep and weep, To feel the hand that lies on me, My Lady of sleep. Bend above me tenderly, So that thy shadow deep, Shades my limbs from heat of the sun, And my heart from sorrows ne’er done; And hush thee lest I weep and weep, And hush thee lest I weep, To hear the whisp’ring of dreams, My Lady of sleep. Lady of sleep. Lay a dark tress of thy hair Over mine eyes, and keep Still thy cool hand on my brow, So that ever– more as now, Waking not to weep and weep, Waking not to weep and weep, I may rest in love of thee, Dear Lady of Sleep, Dear Lady of Sleep!
