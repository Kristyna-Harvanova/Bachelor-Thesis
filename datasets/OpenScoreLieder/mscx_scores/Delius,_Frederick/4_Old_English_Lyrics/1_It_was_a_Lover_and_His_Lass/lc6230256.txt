It was a lover and his lass With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino That o'er the green cornfield did pass In the Springtime the only pretty ringtime When the birds do sing hey dingading ding, Sweet lovers love the Spring Between the acres of the rye With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino These pretty country folk would lie In the Springtime the only pretty ringtime When birds do sing hey dingading ding Sweet lovers love the spring. hey nonino hey nonino hey nonino And therefore take the present time With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino; For love is crowned with the prime In the springtime the only pretty ring time When the birds do sing hey dingading ding Sweet lovers love the Spring Hey nonino hey nonino hey nonino hey nonino.
