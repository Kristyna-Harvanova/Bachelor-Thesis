Have you seen but a white lily grow, Before rude hands have touched it? Have you marked but the fall of the snow, Before the soil hath smutched it? Have you felt the wool of the beaver? Or swanâ€™s down ever? Or have smelt of the bud of the briar? Or the nard in the fire? Or have tasted the bag of the bee? O so white! O so soft! O so sweet is she!
