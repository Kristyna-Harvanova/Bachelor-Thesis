A garden, bright with flowers, All fresh with morning dew, A blackbird near us singing; How fast the moments flew, A little form beside me, A hand in both my own; A word in whispers spoken, No more am I a– lone. A little form beside me, A hand in both my own, A word in whispers spoken, No more am I a– lone. Now flowers close their petals, The blackbird’s song is done, The morning hours ended, The long, long night be– gun; A little grave beside me, A cross of carven stone, A little flower faded, And I am quite a– lone; A little grave beside me, A cross of carven stone, A little flower faded, And I am quite a– lone.
