In dreams I look on an Angel face, And a pleasant hand I feel, While the bluebells and anemones Ring out a wedding peal And together, there, in the quiet dusk, ’Neath a dome of Heaven’s blue, we make our vows, like sacred vows To be patient, fond, and true. And I make a vow, in my earnest love, That so dear she is to me, That I will love no other love Thro’ all eterni– ty. She never stands by the river now, Be– neath the fields of blue, And I know no more of her tender love, So patient, fond, and true; For the gentle face that I look’d upon, And the voice that softly fell, Have pass’d away thro’ the summer lands To the place where angels dwell. But the vows which I made in that holy place Are sacred vows to me, For I will love no other love Thro’ all eternity, For I will love no other love Thro’ all eternity!
