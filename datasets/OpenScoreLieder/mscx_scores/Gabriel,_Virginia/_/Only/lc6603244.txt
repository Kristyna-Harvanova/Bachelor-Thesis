so I must strive to for mine for ever and aye.
1. Only a face at the window, Only a face, nothing more; Yet the look in the eyes, as they meet mine, Still comes to me o’er to and o’er Only a word, man, of greeting, Only a word that was all; Yet all day, in my heart it conechoed, Like the sound of an anman gel’s call.
