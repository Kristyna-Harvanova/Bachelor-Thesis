The sea ran high, and the wind was wild, When the Skipper call’d to his only child, “My boy, if fears assail thee now, Go pray in silence down below.” “Fear!” cried the boy, “I know not fear Father when thy right hand is near; But merry it is o’er the waves so high, To ride together my father and I! to ride together my father and I!” “Mother will watch from the door and pray For us both, dear Father ’till break of day, And she’ll be the first when her prayer is done To catch sight of our sail ’neath the morning sun.” “Yes, yes,” quoth the skipper, brief and stern, “Tomorrow shall see our bark return, O’er the green waves! ’neath the morning sky, We’ll ride together my boy and I. We’ll ride together my boy and I.” She is watching, watching, but never more, Will that gallant skipper return to shore. The boy's black handkerchief lies on the sand, It was tied round his neck with her parting hand; And all that doth of the skipper remain, Is the compass he never shall use again But she knows that now on the Jasper sea, They ride together his father and he, They ride together his father and he.
