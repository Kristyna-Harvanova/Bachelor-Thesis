With many a curve my banks I fret By many a field and fallow, And many a fairy foreland set With willow, weed, and mallow: I slip, I slide, I gleam, I glance, Among my skimming swallows, I make the netted sunbeam dance Against my sandy shallows, I chatter, chatter, as I flow To join the brimming river, For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever, ever, I go on for ever, ever, I go on for ever. I wind about, and in and out With here a blossom sailing, And here and there a lusty trout, And here and there a grayling, And here and there a snowy flake Upon me as I travel, With many a silvery waterbreak Above the golden gravel, And draw them all along, I flow To join the brimming river, For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever, ever, I go on for ever, ever, I go on for ever. I steal by lawns and grassy plots, I slide by hazel covers; I move the sweet forgetmenots, That grow for happy lovers. I murmur under moon and stars In brambly wildernesses I linger by my shingly bars I loiter round my cresses. And out again I curve and flow To join the brimming river, For men may come and men may go, But I go on for ever, ever, I go on for ever, ever, I go on for ever.
