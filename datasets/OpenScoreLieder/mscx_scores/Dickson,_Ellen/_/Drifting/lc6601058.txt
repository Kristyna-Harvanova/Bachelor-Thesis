When descends on the Atlantic The gigantic stormwind of the Equi– nox, Landward in his wrath he scourges The toiling surges, Laden with seaweed from the rocks–––– Ever drifting, drifting, drifting on the shifting currents of the restless main; Till in shelter’d coves, and reaches, of sandy beaches, All have found repose again. So, when storms of wild emotion Strike the ocean of the poet’s soul, ere long From each cave and rocky fastness, In its vastness, Floats some fragment of a song; Ever drifting, drifting, drifting on the shifting currents of the restless heart; Till at length in books re– corded, They, like hoarded household words, No more de– part.
