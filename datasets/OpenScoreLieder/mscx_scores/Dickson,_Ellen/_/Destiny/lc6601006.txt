An infant slept upon his mother’s bosom, Like some sweet rosebud on the parent stem, A teardrop glisten’d on the op’ning blossom, More pure than dew, and brighter than a gem; The mother mus’d upon her baby’s future, How bright may be that future, who can say? Fond mother, dream, from thee the picture’s hidden, But angel hands will raise the veil some day, Fond mother, dream, from thee the picture’s hidden, But angel hands will raise the veil some day. The infant slept, but cold and still was lying, More pure, more fair, un– touch’d by earthly stain, For angel forms to Paradise are flying, And bear the blossom back to Heav’n a gain. Fulfill’d are now her visions brightly smiling, And dreams that glow’d in fancy’s golden ray. She knoweth well earth’s hopes are oft beguiling, But his bright future ne’er can fade away, She knoweth well, earth’s hopes are oft beguiling, but his bright future ne’er can fade away.
