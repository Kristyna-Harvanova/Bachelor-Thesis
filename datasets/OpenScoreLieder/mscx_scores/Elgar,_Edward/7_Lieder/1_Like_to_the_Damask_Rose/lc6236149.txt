Like to the damask rose you see, Or like a blosdie am on a tree, Or wie die Blume bei dem Hag, Gleich like the morning of the day, Or like the sun, or like the shade, Or like the gourd which Jonas had, E'en such is man  whose thread is spun, Drawn out and cut, and so is ran. The rose Rose withstirbt, ers the die blossom blasteth, The flower fades, the morning hasteth, The sun Sonne sets, the shadow flies, The gourd consumes ‒‒ the man he dies! Like to the grass that's newly sprung, Or like a tale benew begun, Or gleich dem Vogel auf der Au, Dem like the pearlvon dew of May, Or like an hour, or like de span, Or like the singing of a swan, E'en such is man ‒‒ who lives by breath, Is here, now there, in life and death. The grass Gras ist wiwelk, thers, the die tale is ended, The bird is flown, the dew's ascended; The hour is short, the span not long; The hour is short, the span not long; The swan's near death, Man's life is done!
