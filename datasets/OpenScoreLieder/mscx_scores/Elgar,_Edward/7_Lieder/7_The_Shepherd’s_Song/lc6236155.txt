Down the dusty road together Homeward pass the hurrying sheep, Stupid with the summer weather, Too much grass and too much sleep, I, their shepherd, sing to thee That summer is a joy to me. Down the shore rolled waves all creamy With the flecked surf yesternight; I swam far out in starlight dreamy, In moving waters cool and bright, I, the shepherd, sing to thee: I love the strong life of the sea. And upon the hillside growing Where the fat sheep dozed in shade, Bright red poppies I found blowing, Drowsy, tall and loosely made, I, the shepherd, sing to thee How fair the bright red poppies be. To the redtiled homestead bending Winds the road, so white and long Day and work are near their ending Sleep and dreams will end my song, I, the shepherd, sing to thee; In the dreamtime answer, answer me, In the dreamtime answer, answer me.
