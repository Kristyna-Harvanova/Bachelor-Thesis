A poet sang, so light of heart was he, A song that thrilled with joy in ev’ry word: It quiver’d with ecstatic melody; It laughed as sunshine laughs upon the sea; It caught a measure from each lilting bird; But, though the song rang out exultantly, The world pass’d by, with heavy step and loud, None heeding, save that, parted from the crowd, Two lovers heard. There fell a day when sudden sorrow smote The poet’s life. Unheralded it came, Blotting the suntouch’d page whereon he wrote His golden song. Ah! then, from all from all remote, He sang the grief that had nor hope nor name In God’s ear only, In God’s ear only; But one sobbing note Reached the world's heart, And swiftly, swiftly, in the wake Of bitterness and passion and heartbreak, There in follow’d fame; One sobbing note reach’d the world's heart, There follow’d fame and swiftly, swiftly jethere follow’d dem fame.
