“Where shall we go for our garlands glad At the falling of the year When the burntup banks are yellow and sad When the boughs are yellow and sere? When the boughs are yellow and sere? Where are the old ones that once we had And when are the new en ones near? What shall we do for our garlands glad At the falling, At the falling of the year? “Child! can I tell where the garlands go? Can I say where the lost leaves veer? On the brown burnt banks, when the wild winds blow When they drift thro’ the deadwood in’s drear? When they drift thro’ the deadwood in’s drear? Girl! when the garlands of next year glow You may gather again, my dear; But I go where the last year's die lost leaves go At the falling of the year, At the falling of the year.”
