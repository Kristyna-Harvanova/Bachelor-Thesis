Through the long days and years What will my lov'd one be, Parted from me? Through the long days and years. Always as then she was Loveliest, brightest, best, Blessing and blest, Always as then she was. Never on earth again Shall I before her stand, Touch lip or hand Never on earth again. But, while my darling lives, Peaceful I journey on, Not quite alone, Not while my darling lives, While my darling lives.
