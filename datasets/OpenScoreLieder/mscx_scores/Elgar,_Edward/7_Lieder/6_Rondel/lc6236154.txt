Love, love, what wilt thou with this heart, this heart of mine? Nought see I sure or fixed in thee! I do not know thee, nor what deeds are thine: Love, what wilt thou with this heart, this heart of mine? Nought see I fixed or sure in thee, Nought see I fixed or sure in thee! Shall I be mute, or vows with prayers combine? Ye who are blessed in loving, tell it me: Love, what willt thou with this heart, this heart of mine? Nought see I permanent or sure in thee, Nought see I permanent or sure in thee: Love, Love, what willt thou with this heart of mine?
