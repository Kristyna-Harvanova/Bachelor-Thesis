Come, O my love! Come, fly to me; All my soul Cries out for thee: Haste to thy home, I long for thee, Faint for thee, Worship thee only,-but Come! Dark is the wood,-The track's ever lonely and gray: But joyous the blaze That welcomes and shews thee the way. Come, O my love! Come, fly to me; All my soul Cries out for thee: Haste to thy rest, I long for thee, Sigh for thee, Faint for thee; Come to my breast. Cold is the stream,-The ford is a danger to thee: My heart is a flame, As the beacon that lights thee to me. Come, O my love! Come, fly to me; All my soul Cries out for thee: Haste to thy home, I long for thee, Faint for thee, Worship thee only; but Come!
