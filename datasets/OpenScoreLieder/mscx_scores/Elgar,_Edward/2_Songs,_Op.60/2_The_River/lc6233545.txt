River, mother of fighting men, (Rustula!) Sternest barrier of our land, (Rustula!) From thy bosom we drew life: Ancient, honoured, mighty, grand! Rustula! Oh! what worship had been thine, (Rustula!) Hadst thou held the foemen, drowned; (Rustula!) Flood, more precious far than wine, Victress, saviour, worldrenowned! Rustula! Rustula! Like a girl before her lover, (Rustula!) How thou falterdst, ‒ like a slave; ‒ (Rustula!) Sank and fainted, low and lower, When thy mission was to save. Coward, traitress, shameless! Rustula! On thy narrowed, niggard strand, (Rustula!) Despairing, ‒ now the tyrant's hand (Rustula!) Grips the last remnant of our land, Wounded and alone I stand, Tricked, derided, impotent! Rustula! Rustula!
