Is she not passing fair, She whom I love so well? On earth, in sea, or air, Where may her equal dwell? Oh tell me, ye who dare To brave her beauty's spell, Is she not passing fair, She whom I love so well? Whether she speak or sing, Be jocund or serene, Alike in ev'rything, Is she not beauty's queen? Whether she speak or sing, Be jocund or serene, Alike in ev'rything, Is she not beauty's queen? Is she not passing fair, She whom I love so well? On earth, in sea, or air, Where may her equal dwell? Then let the world declare, let all who see her tell, That she is passing fair, passing fair, She whom I love so well!
