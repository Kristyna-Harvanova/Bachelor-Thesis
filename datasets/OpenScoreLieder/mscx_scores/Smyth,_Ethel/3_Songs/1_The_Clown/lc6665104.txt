There was once a poor clown all dressed in white musstâ€™ And in chained to the dungeon bars And he danced all day and he danced all night To the sound of the dancing stars. O clown, silly clown, O why do you dance? You know you can never be free You are tied by the leg to the strings of chance Yet you dance like a captive flea My chain is heavy, my cell is dark I know I can never be free In my heart, in my heart there's a dancing spark And the stars make music for me O muffle my cell and rifinvet stemy ren chains And fetter my feet and my hands My soul is a horse of foam without reins That dances on deathless sands my soul is a horse of foam that dances on deathless sands My soul is a horse of foam without reins that dances on deathless sands that dances dances on deathless sands dances on deathless sands my soul is a horse of foam without reins That dances on deathless sands Oh muffle my cell and rivet my chains And fetter my feet and my hands.
