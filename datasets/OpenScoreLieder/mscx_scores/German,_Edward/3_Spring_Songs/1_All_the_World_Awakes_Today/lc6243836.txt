All the world awakes today To the music of the May. Bird and bee and stream are one In harmonious orison. In your beauteous, beauteous youthful eyes Love lies dreaming lazily; When he stirs, as will be soon, Maiden, may I set the tune? Such a moving merry number Will I use to wake his slumber, Our two hearts will trip a measure Full of wild uncounted pleasure, Our two hearts will trip a measure Full of wild uncounted pleasure ’Tis the very time and place For such a wakening to grace; All the world awakes to day To the music of the May, To the music of the May, All the world awakes today, All the world awakes today, So with love we’ll crown the May.
