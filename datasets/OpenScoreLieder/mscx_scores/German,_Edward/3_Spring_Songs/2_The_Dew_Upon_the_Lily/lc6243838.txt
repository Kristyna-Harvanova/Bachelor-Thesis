The dew upon the lily, The blush upon the rose, Has no more rare and tender charm Than round thy presence grows. There’s music in the meadow, There’s rapture in the air, When through the throng of whisp’ring flowers, the throng of whisp’ring flowers Thy dainty feet repair. The hawthorn waves above thee, The violet peeps below, And ev’ry bloom sheds rich perfume Like incense where you go. I wait where, ’neath the alder, Two wand’ring brooklets meet; Oh! Come my Queen of love and joy, my Queen of love and joy, And make the Spring complete complete.
