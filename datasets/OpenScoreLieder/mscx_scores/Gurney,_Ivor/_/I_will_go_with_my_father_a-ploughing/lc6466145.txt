I will go with my father aploughing To the green field by the sea, And the rooks and the crows and the seagulls Will come flocking after me; I will sing to the patient horses With the lark in the white of the air, And my father will sing the ploughsong, my father will sing the ploughsong That blesses the cleaving share. I will go with my father asowing To the red field by the sea, And the rooks and the gulls and the starlings Will come flocking after me. I will sing to the striding sowers With the finch on the greening sloe, And my father will sing the seedsong, my father will sing the seedsong That only the wise men know. I will go with my father areaping To the brown field by the sea, And the geese and the crows and the children Will come flocking after me. I will sing to the tanfaced reapers With the wren in the heat of the sun, And my father will sing the scythe song, My father will sing the scythe song That joys for the harvest done.
