Spring, the sweet Spring, is the year's pleasant King, Then blooms each thing, then maids dance in a ring, Cold doth not sting, the pretty birds do sing Cuckoo, jugjug, puwe, towittawoo The palm and may make country houses gay, Lambs frisk and play, the shepherdâ€™s pipe all day, And we hear aye birds tune this merry lay Cuckoo, jugjug, puwe. Spring, Spring, the sweet Spring!
