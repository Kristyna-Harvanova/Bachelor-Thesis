At the last, tenderly, From the walls of the powerful fortressâ€™d house, From the clasp of the knotted locks, from the keep of the well closed doors, Let me be wafted. Let me glide noiselessly forth; with the key of softness unlock the locks, with a whisper, Set ope the doors, O Soul. Tenderly be not impatient, Strong is your hold O Mortal flesh, Strong is your hold, O Love.
