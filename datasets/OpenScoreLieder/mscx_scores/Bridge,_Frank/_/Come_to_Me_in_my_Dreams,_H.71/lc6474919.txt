Come to me in my dreams, and then By day I shall be well again, For then the night will more than pay The hopeless longing of the day. Come! as thou cam’st a thousand times, A messenger from radiant climes, And smile on thy new world, and be As kind to all the rest as me. Or, as thou never cam’st in sooth, Come now, and let me dream it truth; And part my hair, and kiss my brow, And say,  — My love! why suff’rest thou? Come to me in my dreams, and then By day I shall be well again, For then the night will more than pay The hopeless longing of the day.
