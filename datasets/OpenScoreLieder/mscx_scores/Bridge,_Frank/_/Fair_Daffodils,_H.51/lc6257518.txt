Fair Daffodils, we weep to see You haste away so soon; As yet the earlyrising sun Has not attained his noon. Stay, stay, Until the hasting day Has run But to the evensong; And, having pray’d together, we Will go with you along. We have short time to stay, as you, We have as short a spring; As quick a growth to meet decay, As you, or anything. We die, as your hours do, and dry Away, Like to the summer’s rain; Or, as the pearls of morning’s dew, Ne’er to be found again.
