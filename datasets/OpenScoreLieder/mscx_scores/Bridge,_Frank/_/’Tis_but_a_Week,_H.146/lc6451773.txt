’Tis but a week since down the glen The trampling horses came Half a hundred fighting men With all their spears aflame! They laughed and clattered as they went, And round about their way The blackbirds sang with one consent In the green leaves of May. Never again shall I see them pass; They'll come victorious never Their spears are withered all as grass, Their laughter’s laid for ever; And where they clattered as they went, And where their hearts were gay, The blackbirds sing with one consent In the green leaves of May.
