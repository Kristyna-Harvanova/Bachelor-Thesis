Thy hand in mine, Thy hand in mine, And through the world we two will go, With love before us as a sign, Our faces set to ev'ry foe. Thy hand in mine, Thy hand in mine. My heart in thine, My heart in thine, Through life, through happy death the same, We two will kneel before the shrine, And keep alight the sacred flame. My heart in thine, My heart in thine.
