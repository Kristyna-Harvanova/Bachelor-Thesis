Love went ariding, Love went ariding over the earth, On Pegasus he rode The flowers before him sprang to birth, And the frozen rivers flowed. Then all the youths and the maidens cried, “Stay here with us,” “Stay here with us, “King of Kings!” But Love said, “No! for the horse I ride, for the horse I ride has wings. Love went ariding, Love went ariding over the earth, On Pegasus he rode.
