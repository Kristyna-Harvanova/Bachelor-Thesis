When Israel was in Egypt's lan' Let my people go, Oppress'd so hard they could not stand Let my people go. Go down, Moses, 'Way down in Egypt's lan', Tell ole Pharoh, to let my people go. Thus saith the Lord, bold Moses said, Let my people go, If not I'll smite your firstborn dead, Let my people go. Go down, Moses, 'Way down in Egypt's lan', Tell ole Pharoh, to let my people go!
