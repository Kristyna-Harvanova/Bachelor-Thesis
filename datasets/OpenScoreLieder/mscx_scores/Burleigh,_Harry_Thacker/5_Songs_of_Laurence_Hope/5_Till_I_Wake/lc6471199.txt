When I am dying, lean over me tenderly, softly, Stoop as the yellow roses, Stoop as the yellow roses droop in the wind from the South, droop in the wind from the South So I may when I wake, So I may when I awake: If there be an awak'ning, If there be an awak'ning. So I may when I wake Keep what lull'd me to sleep; the touch of your lips the touch of your lips the touch of your lips, on my mouth, The touch of your lips on my mouth.
