Pale hands I lov'd beside the Shalimar, Where are you now? Who lies beneath your spell? Whom do you lead on Rapture's roadway, far, Before you agonize them in farewell? Oh, pale dispensers of my Joys and Pains, Holding the doors of Heav'n and Hell, How the hot blood rush'd wildly through the veins (Oh pale soft hands!) Beneath your touch, until youi wav'd farewell. Pale hands, pink tipp'd, like Lotus buds that float On those cool waters where we used to dwell, I would have rather felt you round my throat, I would have rather felt you round mny throat, Crushing out life, Crushing out life, than waving me farewell! Pale hands I lov'd, Where are you now?
