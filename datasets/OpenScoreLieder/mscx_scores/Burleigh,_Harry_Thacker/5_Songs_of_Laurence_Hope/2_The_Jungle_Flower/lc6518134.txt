Thou art one of the jungle flow'rs, strange and fierce and fair; Palest amber perfect lines, and scented with champa flow'r: Lie back and frame thy face in the gloom of the loosen'd hair Sweet thou art and lved ay, lov'd for an hour! But thought flies far, ah, far, to another breast, Whose whiteness breaks to the rose of a twin pink flow'r, Where wind the azure veins that my lips caress'd When Fate was gentle to me for a toobrief hour!
