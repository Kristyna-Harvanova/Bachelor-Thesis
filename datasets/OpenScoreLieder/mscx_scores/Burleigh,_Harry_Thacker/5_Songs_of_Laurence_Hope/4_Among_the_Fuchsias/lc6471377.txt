Call me not to a secret place When daylight dies away, Tempt me not with thine eager face And words thou shouldst not say. En-tice me not with a child of thine, Ah, God, if such might be, For surely a man is half divine Who adds another link to the line Whose last link none may see. Call me not to the Lotus lake That drooping fuchsias hide, What if my latent youth awake And will not be denied? Ah, tempt me not for I am not strong (Thy mouth is a budded kiss) My days are empty, my nights are long: Ah, why is a thing so sweet so wrong, Why is a thing so sweet so wrong As they temptation is?
