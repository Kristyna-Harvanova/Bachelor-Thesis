Closed in the parlor we are alone Happy to be with one that I love I'll ask you kindly oh Mamie dove Do speak just a few words to bind us in love I will confess that I have been false The other girl was really the cause She is a flirt too, and never still I don't love none but you please say you will Must I plead must I kneel and you not forgive Has your heart love been sealed do you love me still You have always been true now why not forgive I don't love none but you please say you will
