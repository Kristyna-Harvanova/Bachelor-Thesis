As o’er her loom the Lesbian Maid, In lovesick langour hung her head, Unknowing where her fingers stray’d, She weeping turn’d away and said Oh! my sweet mother, ’tis in vain, I cannot weave as once I wove; So wilder’d is my heart and brain, With thinking of that youth I love, that youth I love! Oh, my sweet mother, ’tis in vain__ So wilder’d is my heart and brain, With thinking of that youth I love, that youth I love. Again the web she tried to trace, But tears fell o’er each tangled thread, While looking in her mother’s face Who, o’er her watchful lean’d she said, Oh! my sweet mother, ’tis in vain, I cannot weave as once I wove; So wilder’d is my heart and brain, With thinking of that youth I love, that youth I love!
