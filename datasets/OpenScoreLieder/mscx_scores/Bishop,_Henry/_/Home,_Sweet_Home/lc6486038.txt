’Mid pleasures and Palaces though we may roam, Be it ever so humble there’s no place like home! A charm from the skies seems to hallow us there Which seek through the world, is ne’er met with elsewhere Home! Home sweet sweet Home! There’s no place like Home! There’s no place like Home! An Exile from Home, Splendour dazzles in vain! Oh! give me my lowly thatch’d Cottage again! The Birds singing gaily that came at my call, Give me them with that peace of mind dearer than all Home! Home sweet sweet Home! There’s no place like Home! There’s no place like Home! ’Mid pleasures and palaces though we may roam, Be it ever so humble there’s no place like Home! Home! Home! sweet sweet Home! There’s no place like Home! There’s no place like Home! There’s no place like Home! There’s no place like Home! no place like Home!
