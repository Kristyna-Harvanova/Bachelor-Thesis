1. Do you remember the days in the mountains? Do you remember the mist on the lea? Do you remember the scent of the wildflow’rs? And are these mem’ries still mem’ries of me? Do you remember the dew on the fernleaves Down by the brook that flows on to the sea? Do you remember the songs sung together? And, thus rememb’ring, think sometimes of me? Re member, remember, Altho’ we’re apart, Thro’ silence and distance You still hold my heart. heart.
