1. Through ev’ry ill that may betide I’ll stand forever by your side Willing and glad to be with you Proving my friendship strong and true 1 & 2. Because you are my friend On me you may de– pend; I'll stand forever by your side, Because you are my friend Dark days may come to you Those whom you trust prove untrue Still on my love you may depend, Because I am your friend
