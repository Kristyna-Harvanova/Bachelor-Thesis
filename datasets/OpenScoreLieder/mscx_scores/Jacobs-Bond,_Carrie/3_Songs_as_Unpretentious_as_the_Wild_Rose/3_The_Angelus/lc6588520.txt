Now the bells are sweetly ringing, And the vesper hour is here. For thy sake a song Iâ€™m singing, Dearest love of mine, And I'm praying winds are bringing Back some thoughts of thine, Loving thoughts to cheer my sadness, And to dim my fears, whispered thoughts of loving gladness Making smiles of tears, Making smiles of tears.
