She is gentle and also wise; Of all other she beareth the prize, That ever I saw. To hear her sing, to see her dance! She will the best herself advance, That ever I saw. To see her fingers that be so small! In my conceit she passeth all that ever I saw. Nature in her hath wonderly wrought, Christ never such another bought, That ever I saw. I have seen many that have beauty, Yet is there none like to my lady That ever I saw. Therefore I dare this boldly say, I shall have the best and fairest may That ever I saw, that ever I saw.
