Art thou poor, yet hast thou golden slumbers? O sweet content! Art thou rich, yet is thy mind perplexèd? O punishment! Dost thou laugh to see how fools are vexèd to add To golden numbers, golden numbers? O sweet content, O sweet, O sweet content! Work apace, apace, apace; Honest labour bears a lovely face, Then hey nonny nonny, hey nonny nonny! Canst drink the waters of the crisped spring? O sweet content! Swim’st thou in wealth, yet sink’st in thine own tears? O punishment! Then he that patiently wants, burden bears, no burden bears, but is a King, a King. O sweet content, O sweet, O sweet content! Work apace, apace, apace, Honest labour bears a lovely face, Then Hey nonny nonny, hey nonny nonny!
