The rustling nightfall strews my gown with roses, And wineflushâ€™d petals bring forgetfulness Of shadow after shadow striding past: I arise with the stars exultantly, And follow the sweep of the moon along the hushing stream, Where no birds wake. Only the longdrawn sigh of wary voices whispering Farewell!
