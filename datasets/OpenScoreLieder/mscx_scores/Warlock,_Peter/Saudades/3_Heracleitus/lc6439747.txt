They told me, Heracleitus, they told me you were dead, They brought me bitter news to hear and bitter tears to shed; I wept as I remembered how often you and I Had tired the sun with talking and sent him down the sky. And now that thou art lying, my dear old Carian guest, A handful of grey ashes, long, long ago at rest, Still are thy pleasant voices, thy nightingales, awake. For Death, he taketh all away, But them he cannot take.
