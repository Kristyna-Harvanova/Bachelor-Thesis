In a harbour* grene aslepe whereas I lay The byrdes sang swete in the middes of the day, I dreamèd fast of mirth and play: In youth is pleasure, in youth is pleasure. Methought I walkèd still to and fro And from her company I could not go, But when I wakèd it was not so: In youth is pleasure, in youth is pleasure. Therefore my heart is surely pyght* Of her alone to have a sight. Which is my joy and hearte’s delight: In youth is pleasure, in youth is pleasure.
