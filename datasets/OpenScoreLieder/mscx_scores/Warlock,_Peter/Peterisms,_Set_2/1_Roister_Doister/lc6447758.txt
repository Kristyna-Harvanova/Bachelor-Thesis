I mun be married a Sunday, I mun be married a Sunday, Whosoever shall come that way, I mun be married a Sunday. Roister Doister is my name, Roister Doister is my name, A lusty brute I am the same, I mun be married a Sunday. Christian Custance have I found, Christian Custance have I found, A widow worth a thousand pound, I mun be married a Sunday. Custance is as sweet as honey, Custance is as sweet as honey, I her lamb and she my coney; I mun be married a Sunday. When we shall make our wedding feast, When we shall make our wedding feast, There shall be cheer for man and beast; I mun be married a Sunday. I mun be married a Sunday, I mun be married a Sunday; Whosoever shall come that way, I mun be married a Sunday.
