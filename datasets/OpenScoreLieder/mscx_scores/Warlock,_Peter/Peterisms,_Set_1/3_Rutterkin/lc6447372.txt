Rutterkin is come unto our town In a cloak without coat or gown save ragged hood to cover his crown Like a Rutterkin, Hoyda, hoyda, jolly Rutterkin! Hoyda, hoyda, jolly Rutterkin! Hoyda, hoyda, hoy da! Like a Rutter kin, hoyda! Rutterkin can speak no English, His tongue runneth all on butter’d fish, Besmear’d with grease about his dish, Like a Rutterkin, Hoyda, hoyda, jolly Rutterkin! Hoyda, hoyda, jolly Rutterkin! Hoyda, hoyda, hoy da! Like a Rutter kin, hoyda! Rurterkin shall bring you all good luck, A stoup of beer up at a pluck Till his brain be as wise as a duck, Like a Rutterkin, Hoyda, hoyda, jolly Rutterkin! Hoyda, hoyda jolly Rutterkin! Hoyda, hoyda, hoy da! Like a Rutter kin, Hoyda!
