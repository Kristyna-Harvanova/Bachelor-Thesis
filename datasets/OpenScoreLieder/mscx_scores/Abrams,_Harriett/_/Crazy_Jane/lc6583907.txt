Why fair Maid in ev’ry feature are such signs of fear express’d can a wand’ring wretched creature with such terror fill thy breast, do my frenzied looks alarm thee trust me sweet thy fears are vain. not for Kingdoms would I harm thee, shun not then, poor Crazy Jane. Dost thou weep to see my anguish, mark me and avoid my woe when men flatter, sigh, and languish, think them false I found them so for I lov’d, oh so sincerely none could ever love again but the Youth I loved so dearly stole the wits of Crazy Jane. Fondly my young heart receiv’d him, which was doom’d to love but one he sigh’d, he vow’d and I believ’d him he was false and I undone from that hour has reason never held her Empire o'er my brain Hen’ry fled with him for ever fled the wits of Crazy Jane. Now forlorn and brokenhearted and with frenzied thoughts beset on the spot where last we parted on that spot where first we met still I sing my lovelorn ditty still I slowly pace the plain whilst each passer by in pity cries God help thee, Crazy Jane.
