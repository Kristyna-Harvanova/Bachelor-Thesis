The frozen streets in Moonshine glitter, the midnight hour has long been past, ah me the wind blows keen and bit ter, I sink beneath the piercing blast in every Vein seems life to languish their weight my limbs no more can bear But no one soothes the Orphan's anguish and no one heeds the Orphan's prayer. Hark, hark, for surely footsteps near me advancing press the drifted Snow! I die for food oh Stranger hear me, I die for food some alms bestow, you see no guilty wretch implore you no want on pleads in feign'd despair a famish'd Orphan kneels before you oh grant the famish'd Orphan's prayer. Perhaps you think my lips dissembling of virtuous sorrows feign a tale, then mark my frame with anguish trembling, my hollow eyes, and fea tures pale, E'en should my story prove I deal too well these wasted limbs declare my wants at least are not unreal then Stranger grant the Orphan's prayer. Heâ€™s gone! no mercy man will show me in prayers no more I'll waste my breath, here on the frozen Earth I'll throw me and wait in mute despair for death farewell, thou cruel world tomorrow no more thy scorn my heart will tear, the grave will shield the Child of sorrow and Heaven will hear the Orphan's prayer. But thou proud Man the Beggar scorning unmoved who saw'st me kneel for bread, thy heart shall ache to hear at morning that morning found the Beggar dead and when the room resounds with laughter my famish'd cry thy mirth shall scare and often shalt thou wish hearafter thou hadst not scorned the Orphan's prayer.
