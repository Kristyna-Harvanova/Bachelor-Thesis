Oh! woman, sweet woman, our blessing our bane, What will we not peril thy smiles to obtain; Wealth, honor, dominion, and glory we prize, But as baubles to dazzle of beauty the eyes; Lured on by their lustre, we count not the cost, So woman be won, what’s the world we have lost? Lured on by their lustre we count not the cost, So woman be won, what’s the world we have lost? So woman be won, what’s the world we have lost? Oh! but for the flame at Love’s altar they caught, What bard would have sung or what soldier have fought; How barren the conquest, how poor the renown Had woman been wanting the victor to crown. Had Love ne’er existed, my sweet Madame Fame, The millions that seek thee had ne’er known the name. Lured on by Love’s lustre we count not the cost, So woman be won, what’s the world we have lost? So woman be won, what’s the world we’ve lost?
