Daughter of Egypt, veil thine eyes! I cannot bear their fire; Nor will I touch with sacrifice Those altars of desire. For they are flames that shun the day, And their unholy light Is fed from natures gone astray In passion and in night. The stars of Beauty and of Sin, They burn amid the dark, Like beacons that to ruin win The fascinated bark. Then veil their glow, lest I forswear The hopes thou canst not crown, And in the black waves of thy hair, My struggling manhood drown!
