Lowland lassie will ye go Where the hills are clad wi’ snow, Where beneath the icy steep Hardy shepherds tend their sheep; Ill nor wae shall thee betide, Row’d within my Highland plaid, Lowland lassie will ye go Where the hills are clad wi’ snow. Then we’ll leave the sheep and goat, I will launch the bonnie boat, Skim the loch in cantie glee, Rest the oars to pleasure thee, When chilly breezes sweep the tide I’ll row thee in my Highland plaid, Lowland lassie will ye go Where the hills are clad wi’ snow. Highland lad ye’ve been sae leil, My haert wad break at our farewell, Lang your love has made me fain, Tak! oh tak me for your ain Cross the firth away they glide, Donald and his Lowland bride, ’Cross the firth away they glide, Donald and his Lowland bride.
