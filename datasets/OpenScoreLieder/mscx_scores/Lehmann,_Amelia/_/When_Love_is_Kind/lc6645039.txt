When Love is kind cheerful and free Love’s sure to find welcome from me. But when love brings heart ache and pang, Tears and such things, Love may go hang. If Love can sigh for one alone Well pleas’d am I to be that one, But should I see Love giv’n to rove To two or three, then good bye Love! Love must in short keep fond and true, Through good re– port, and evil too. Else here I swear young Love may go For aught I care to Jericho! Ah ha ha to Jericho!
