Wisdom and Love, both now assail me, On which shall I poor mortal decide? Help me ye gods! Oh! do not fail me! For by your choice I will abide, For by your choice I will abide. Wisdom with visage cold arrests me, “Thou wilt repent the feast I warn thee,” Then Love appears with all his wiles And leads me on with rosy smiles. Then since that Love is so alluring, But wisdom is the more enduring, Why do ye not your pow’rs unite And put my torments all to flight, my torments all to flight? Wisdom and Love both now assail me On which shall I poor mortal decide? Help me ye gods! Oh! do not fail me, For by your choice I will abide, For by your choice I will abide.
