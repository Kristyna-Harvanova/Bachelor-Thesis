How delicious is the winning Of a kiss at love’s beginning, When two mutual hearts are sighing For the knot there’s no untying; Yet re– member, midst your wooing, Love has bliss but love has ruing, Love has joy, but love has sorrow, Smiles to day, but weeps to morrow. Bind the sea to slumber stilly, Bind the odour to the lily; Bind the aspen ne’er to quiver, Then bind love to last for ever. Love’s a fire that needs renewal Of fresh beauty for its fuel, Love’s wing droops when caged or captur’d, Only free he soars enraptur’d! Love he comes and love he tarries, Just as fate or fancy carries, Longest stays when sorest chidden, Laughs and flies when press’d or bidden. Can you keep the bee from ranging? Or the ringdove’s neck from changing? No! nor fetter’d love from dying In the knot there’s no untying! How de– licious is the winning Of a kiss at love’s beginning, At love’s At love’s beginning.
