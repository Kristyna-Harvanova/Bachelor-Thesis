1. The is Summer is come; she hath said “Rejoice!” The wild woods leaves thrill to her merry voice; Her sweet breath is wand’ring around on high: Sing, sing thro’ the echoing sky! There is joy in the mountains, the bright waves leap Like the boundding the Stag when he breaks from sleep; Mirthfully, wildly they flash along Let the heavens the ring with ing song!
