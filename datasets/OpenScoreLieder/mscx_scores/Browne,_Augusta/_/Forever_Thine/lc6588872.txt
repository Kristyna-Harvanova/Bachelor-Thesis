1. Forever thine! whate’er this heart betide; Forev er thine, where’er our lots he cast; When Fate, that may rob us of all wealth beside, Shall leave us love, till life itself be past. The world may I wrong us, we will brave its hate, False friends the may change, iance and false hopes decline, Tho’ bowed by cank’ring care, we’ll smile at fate, Since thou art mine, beloved, and I am thine! Forever thine! Forev er thine!
